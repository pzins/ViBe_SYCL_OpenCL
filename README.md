## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/pzins/pzins.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/pzins/pzins.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

- **OpenCL** is a well known framework for writing programs which run on heterogeneous devices, such as multicore CPUs, GPUs, DSPs, FPGAs. Using such device in an efficient way, often speeds up the execution of programs. GPUs are very common today, in any computer, and it's important to benefit from their computing power.

- **SYCL** is a C++ abstraction layer over OpenCL which aims to make OpenCL programming easier. Indeed, SYCL allows developpers to benefit from C++ features and brings "single source" programming style, whereas OpenCL is mainly based on C language (a C++ layer is also available) and requires "kernels" (code which is going to be executed on the device) to be written in another file. As OpenCL, SYCL is a specification of the Khronos Group. Codeplay, a scottish company, has a SYCL implementation (and a compiler for the kernels) called ComputeCpp. It is not open-source but a "Community Edition" is available on their website. 

SYCL makes the developpment easier (C++ and single source style), but also have a impact on the global performance. So, it is interesting to estimate the loss in performance invloved by the use of SYCL.

To do that, I chose a method for which using a GPU should probably be beneficial : **[ViBe](https://orbi.ulg.ac.be/bitstream/2268/145853/1/Barnich2011ViBe.pdf)**</br>
Indeed, this is used in computer vision for background substraction and detection.

This method is based on image processing, so doing a same operation on every pixel of an image (frame). This kind of process  called SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) benefit a lot from GPUs use. Indeed, GPUs can execute a same operation many time in parallel.

I developped 3 versions of the ViBe method, with use of the computer vision library OpenCV : 
- Baseline implementation which executes on the CPU (single-thread)
- OpenCL implementation which executes on the GPU or CPU (multi-threade)
- SYCL implementation which executes on the GPU or CPU (multi-thread)

The configuration used:
Hardware :
- CPU : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4770 CPU @ 3.40GHz
- GPU : AMD R9 Fury Nano
Software : 
- OS : Ubuntu 14.04
- OpenCL : AMD implementation (AMD driver fglrx-15.302)
- OpenCL 2.0 (GPU) and 1.2 (CPU)
- SYCL Codeplay implementation : ComputeCpp 0.2.0


Here are the results obtained (with all graphical output disabled)

Obviously the worst result (almost 135s) is obtained with the baseline implementation on the CPU (single thread). Using the hardware in a more efficient way increase a lot the performance.
First, if we look at the CPU. With OpenCL, the CPU is more efficiently used : several threads are launched on the different CPU cores. ViBe is almost 9 times faster in this case. Using SYCL add a litte overhead of almost 50% compared to raw OpenCL.
Results are even better when using GPU, because this kind of device can launch much more thread simultaneously compared to the CPU. OpenCL with GPU gives the best result : 7.56 s (almost 18 times better than the baseline). The overhead added by SYCL is around 100%.
